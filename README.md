Implementing a version of NYTimes Games' Digits

Authors: Meaghan Fowlie and Doug Barr

So far you can generate a random game with the same rules as the original and play it via the command line.

Usage: just run digits.py:

```bash
cd path/to/digits
python digits.py
```
The interface is the interactive command line prompt.

It will create a game with no one-step solution.

## Solver

`solver.py` finds all solutions and partial solutions to a game.
